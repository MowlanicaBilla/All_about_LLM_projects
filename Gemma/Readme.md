# langchain-gemma-ollama-chainlit
Simple Chat UI using the Gemma model via Ollama, LangChain, and Chainlit

### Open Source in Action üöÄ
- [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/model_card) as Large Language model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) as a Framework for LLM
- [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for developing, collaborating, testing, deploying, and monitoring LLM applications.
- [Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/langchain) for deploying.

## System Requirements

You must have Python 3.10 or later installed. Earlier versions of Python may not compile.

## Steps to Replicate 

1. Fork this repository and create a codespace in GitHub OR Clone it locally.
   ```
   https://github.com/MowlanicaBilla/All_about_LLM_projects.git
   cd Gemma
   ```

2. Create a virtualenv and activate it
   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. OPTIONAL - Rename example.env to .env with `cp example.env .env`and input the environment variables from [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/). You need to create an account on the LangSmith website if you haven't already.
   ``` 
   LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
   LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="your-project"
   ```

4. Run the following command in the terminal to install the necessary Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the following command in your terminal to start the chat UI:
   ```
   chainlit run langchain_gemma_ollama.py
   ```

## Disclaimer
This test project is presented in my youtube video to learn new stuff using the available open-source projects and models. It is not meant to be used in production as it's not production-ready. You can modify the code and use it for your use cases ‚úåÔ∏è

# Interviewer Ollama
I tried tweaking the prompt a lil' bit to make the Gemma model pose as an interviewer and ask me questions related to all the latest LLMs, ML etc. But not sure if its the prompt that was the issue but I'm getting a list of questions and answers like the below:
